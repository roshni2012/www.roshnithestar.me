   Have you ever wondered whether there may be a different universe outside the universe in which we reside? While watching the movie “Spiderman: Across the Spider Verse”, you must have wondered how thrilling it would be if there really is a Spider Verse, or more simply, a multiverse, right?
    <br>
   But have you ever wondered what a parallel universe really means?
    <br>
   A hypothetical self-contained plane of existence that coexists with our own is called a parallel universe, alternative universe, parallel world, parallel dimension, or alternate reality. The term "multiverse" refers to the collection of all possible parallel worlds that make up reality.
